## :page_facing_up: Conway's Game of Life Rules 

:arrow_right: `The goal of this challenge is to implement the logic used in Conway's Game of Life. Wikipedia will give a better understanding of what it is and how it works.`

:arrow_right: `For a space that's "populated":`
* Each cell with 0 or 1 neighbours dies, as if by solitude.
* Each cell with 2 or 3 neighbours survives.
* Each cell with 4 or more neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.

:arrow_right: `Game parameters is an 2-dimensional array of values 0 to 1 "board":`
* 0 means the cell is empty.
* 1 means the cell is populated.

:arrow_right: `Return a string containing the board's state after the game logic has been applied once.
The string should be divided by newlines \n to signal the end of each row.`

## :loudspeaker: IMPORTANT NOTE
```diff
- DO NOT confuse yourself between class code activtiy repo submission (which is not marked) and lab repo submission (which is marked!). 
+ However you still have to submit the class activity because this will show your commitmant in class. The lab submission is your homework. 
# Class Activity MUST be a github repo and has a javascript file which will be your playground for your learning, it does not need to have a journal.
! BOTH ARE COMPULSORY. 
```
